# Node Plane Bot Reference

Some buttons appear only in specific cases:
- `Admin` is shown only to admins

## Admin -> Requests

Shows all pending access requests.

Available actions:

A request card usually shows:

- request state
- request timestamp

## Admin -> Servers

This is the main area for server operations.

### Server List

- search, when there is more than one page
- create a new server

### Server Card
- `Probe`
  Check basic connectivity and service state.

### Bootstrap

Depending on the server state, this menu can show:

For bootstrap, reinstall, and delete actions, the bot can also offer:

  Title, flag, region, transport, target, public host, protocols, notes.
- `Xray`
  Host, SNI, fingerprint, TCP/XHTTP ports.

  Public host, iface, port, preset, entropy.
- `Maintenance`
  Technical maintenance actions.

### Advanced -> Maintenance

Main actions:
- `Metrics`
  Host summary: kernel, uptime, loadavg, cpu usage, memory, disk, docker, and service status.
- `Check Ports`
  Check the required ports.
- `Open Ports`
  Try to open the required ports on the node.

  Re-check and repair provisioning state.
- `Sync env`
  Rewrite `node.env` on the node.
- `Sync Xray`
  Re-sync Xray settings.

## Admin -> Profiles

The main profile editor for access management.

Typical actions:
- create a profile
- choose protocols
- choose protocol-specific servers
- edit an existing profile
- delete a profile
- freeze or unfreeze a profile

This is the main UI for provisioning and maintaining user access.

## Admin -> Updates

The updates screen shows:
- whether auto-check is enabled
- when the last check happened
- the last check status
- install mode
- current version
- local source path
- the last update run status
- upstream and latest version, when available
- the last error, when present

Buttons:
- `Check`
  Run a manual update check.
- `Auto-check`
  Enable or disable automatic checks.
- `Update`
  Appears only when an update is available or already running.

## Admin -> Settings

### Main Screen
- `Title`
  Change the bot title used in menus.
- `Requests`
  Open the requests and access settings submenu.
- `Global telemetry`
  Toggle global telemetry behavior.

  Reset local state and, if chosen, remote node state as well.

### Requests & Access
- `Auth Text`
  Edit the message shown before a user gets access.
- `Request notifications: on/off`
  Toggle admin notifications for new access requests.
- `Access requests: on/off`
  Fully enable or disable the access request flow.

## Admin -> Announcement

Basic flow:
- enter the text
- review the preview
- `Edit` or `Send`
- `Cancel` if needed

## Admin -> SSH Key

Shows:
- SSH key setup status
- the public key path
- the next step

The `Details` screen is mainly useful when you need to:
- copy the public key
- understand where it should be installed
- avoid opening a shell just to inspect the key

## Rich UI Navigation and Configuration

Rich UI keeps interactive sections open: buttons and callback text links must
never be placed inside collapsible Details blocks, including nested branches,
because those controls are inaccessible in the iOS client. Read-only information,
QR images and URI text may remain collapsible. Configuration URIs use inline
monospace text, with a visible callback text link below the block to send the URI
as a separate ordinary message for iOS.

AWG configuration paths are `Menu -> Get config -> Server -> AmneziaWG -> Devices
-> Device name`. A sole device is selected automatically, and Back skips the
picker in that case. The Devices breadcrumb still offers explicit device selection.
Long configuration paths support the same ellipsis navigation as other screens;
returning rereads the existing issuance and rechecks access, without storing
configuration contents in the navigation snapshot or creating another issuance.

## Supported Slash Commands

- `/start`: open or refresh the current control message.
- `/help`: show localized usage help.
- `/id`: show the current Telegram identity.
- `/version`: show the installed stack version.
- `/status`: open administrator status, subject to backend authorization.

Legacy operational commands are removed. Provisioning, diagnostics, access,
updates and maintenance use the same backend-backed Telegram screens.
